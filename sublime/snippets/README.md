Usage
=====

1) Run the installSnippets script and reload sublime and start using the snippets in this repo! 
NOTE: the installSnippets script will not work if sublime is not installed in it's default location.

Snippet Guidelines:
===================

1) **prefix** your snippet with ms_ (meaning My Snippet) **initials**

2) Add an underscore and the **name of the extension of the programming language**
associated with your snippet. For example, you create a Swift snippet to compute
fibonacci numbers you would name the file: ms_fibonacci_swift.sublime-snippet

3) In the snippet itself make sure you file both the <tabtrigger> and <scope>
fields. The <**tabtrigger**> is the name used to activate the snippet when coding 
and the <**scope**> is the type of file associated with the snippet (For example
when coding in Java you wouldn't want Swift & Python snippets showing up).
